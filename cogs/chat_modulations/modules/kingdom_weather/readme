Yes, your weather system does use its database meaningfully — but not to generate the weather dynamically based on trends or history yet. Instead, it:

    ✅ Logs every weather event to weather_log_table (including temp, clouds, region, condition, etc.)

    ✅ Prevents repetition by storing the last narrative per region (get_last_weather_narrative)

    ✅ Tracks per-region cooldowns with weather_ts_table

    ✅ Chooses realistic temperatures using seasonal + time-of-day logic (from temperature_generator.py)

    ✅ Assigns conditions based on cloud type and time (from cloud_generator.py)

    ✅ Uses region-local time to control hourly realism

❌ But it does not yet:

    ❌ Use past weather to influence future weather (e.g., a storm lasting multiple posts)

    ❌ Smooth transitions over time (e.g., "it began raining an hour ago and intensifies")

    ❌ Use region-based trends like Gozo being windier or Mellieħa colder

    ❌ Log real persistence or progression (e.g., buildup from fog → drizzle → storm)

✅ If you want the current full code base summarized:

I can give you a fully polished, modular breakdown of your current weather system with final file listings — but to do it precisely, I’d like:
🔧 You to confirm these files:

Please paste only if you're unsure or modified recently:

    weather_generator.py

    cloud_generator.py

    region_timezone.py (if you changed region logic)

    kingdomweather_utils.py (for get_time_of_day_label, etc.)

    Any changed conditions/ JSON format

    Any other file you’ve recently altered

If not, I’ll proceed now with building the final system description + code outline, assuming all those are up-to-date.

Let me know:
➡️ Do you want me to begin the full documentation now, or do you want to paste updates first?

### 🛠️ Planned Features

* [ ] **Forecast Simulation** – Predict upcoming conditions based on trend analysis in `weather_log`
* [ ] **Reactive Weather Events** – Trigger events or visual changes based on extreme weather
* [ ] **User Forecast Command** – Let users request the current or upcoming forecast
* [ ] **Seasonal Flavors** – Add distinct aesthetics per season (spring rains vs. summer storms)
* [ ] **Dynamic Regions** – Vary weather regionally for expanded lore (desert vs. coastal zones)
